# VexU Now
VexU Now is an app developed for the purpose of accessing data related to VEX U robotics competitions. The app usues the RobotEvents API, which updates in real time to provide the most accurate data possible. VexU Now hopes to offer a personalized experience by giving the user the ability to manage the competitions and teams they are interested in, as well as providing a user-friendly interface so users have a hassle-free way of getting the info they are interested in.

## Other
VexU Now was developed during the 2023-2024 season by a member of QVEX (QUEEN), repeat worlds qualifiers and one of the top teams, both in Canada and internationally.

This is a personal project, and at the moment there are no plans other than the intended functionality being worked on as of now.
